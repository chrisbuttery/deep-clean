```
npm install --save deep-clean
```

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

`deep-clean` exports a function. This function works without side effects: input is cloned and *not* modified, the clean object is returned.

```javascript
const deepClean = require('deep-clean');

const dirtyObject = {
    key1: { 
        str: 'str' 
    },
    key2: { 
        emptyObj: {},
        emptyStr: '',
        valid: 43,
        nullValue: null,
        deepEmptyObj: { 
            empty: {}
        }
    },
    key3: 14,
    key4: { 
        a: {}
    }
};


const cleanObject = deepClean(dirtyObject);

/* 
    cleanObject will have all the original properties but those which value is {}, '' or null.
    cleanObject = {
        key1: { 
            str: 'str' 
        },
        key2: {
            valid: 43
        },
        key3: 14 
    }
*/
```

### Should I use it in my project?

Probably not. At least, not yet. I usually follow __semver__ for modules versioning and while it is at 0.x.x you can expect breaking changes.
